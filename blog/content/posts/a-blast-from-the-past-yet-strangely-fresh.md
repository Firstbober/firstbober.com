A strange introduction to a seemingly simple blog for a common person. I wanted to do it for a long, long time now. First, I started with WordPress, but it didn’t stick at all, then I tried to hack a blog on GitHub which is also a history, and here we are.

One can say blogs are now popping everywhere, and I think they always were. The turbulent times at Reddit don’t help in keeping everything in one place. Everyone wants their own part of the floor, or the internet for that matter. And so do I.

Is this blog a meta commentary on the current state of affairs on the internet? Prophecy of yet unknown god to mankind? How do even humans write? (I am a lizard, eeeeeeee dźwig.)

Keeping it short, don’t expect anything more than some self-improvement stuff and random blabbering of some rando from the internet here.
